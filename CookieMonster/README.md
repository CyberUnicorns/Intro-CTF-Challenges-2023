# CookieMonster (Easy)

Our secret agents have gathered intel on [this website](https://CyberUnicorns.github.io/Intro-CTF-Challenges-2023/CookieMonster)! We believe that if we can fool the website into thinking we are Orpheus, we'll be able to infiltrate the server and steal all the cookies!

**Hint**: When you correctly figure out the flag, you'll _know_ it's the solution, but `uniCTF{}` will not pop up.

> Don't even think about looking at the JavaScript... it's all obfuscated!
