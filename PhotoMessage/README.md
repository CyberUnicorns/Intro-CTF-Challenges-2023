# Photo Message (Hard)

Our mascot, the CyberUnicorn, has managed to grab this snazzy picture of the physics demonstration cow, Bessie. They wanted to send you a cute message, but they hid it so well and none of us can find it again. Can you help us?

**Hint** A photo editor (apparantly the Mac one doesn't work well) might be useful. An example is GIMP.
