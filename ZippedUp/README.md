# ZippedUp (Hard)

We've discovered a strange zip file. When we try to open it, the zip keeps prompting us to enter a password. However, we don't know what the password is. BUT, we do know that we have a [wordlist](./wordlist.txt) that just might contain the password to the zip file.

> **Hint**: There's more inside the ZIP file after you find the password!
