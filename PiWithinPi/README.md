# Pi Within Pi (Hard)

Check out [this cool file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c3SJAxCUdOjOVkkSYw43O7JELZjg8ae9/view?usp=sharing) our mascot CyberUni found! Except.... there doesn't seem to be anything interesting about it... is there?

Download the file to find out!

**Hint 1**: You'll need Linux to solve this. One option is the CyberStart VM/other VM (ask Ganning or Jolie for help!), WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux, ask Jolie for help!), a Mac terminal (ask Ganning for help), or dual boot/install Linux on your computer! If you don't have any, let Ganning or Jolie know and we will find a way for you to try this challenge out :)

**Hint 2**: Here's a [similar challenge on PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/129?page=1&search=matr)

**Hint 3**: Have you *really* found the last file yet?

**Hint 4**: See the sources document! (and scroll down)

**Hint 5**: Still stuck? Try posting in #cybersecurity-discussion or ask Jolie/Ganning! OR come to one of our future meetings where we cover this concept! :D
